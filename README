n-Sum Groups

ABSTRACT: "We analyze when a group can be written as the prod-
uct of its proper subgroups. We follow the work of Cohn by proving
the necessary machinery in detail and then proving some of the
main theorems, including the necessary and sufficient conditions
for writing groups as a product of 2 through 4 subgroups. This
paper was written as part of a class project."
